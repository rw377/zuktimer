# Zuk Timer
This is a website created to be utilized for Oldschool Runescape's TzKal-Zuk fight within the Inferno. 

Click anywhere on the page to start and pause the timer. After 3 clicks, the timer continues as expected but the clicking is disabled to prevent misclicks. To restart the timer, simply refresh the page. There is also a 5 second beep countdown for each timer. To disable this, mute the site in your web browser (in Chrome, right click the tab > Mute Site).

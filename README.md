# Zuk Timer
This is a website to be utilized as a helper for Oldschool Runescape's TzKal-Zuk fight within the Inferno. 

Click anywhere on the page to start and pause the timer. After 3 clicks, the timer continues as expected but further clicking is disabled to prevent misclicks. To restart the timer, simply refresh the page. 

Note: The background will flash and beep sounds will play for the final 5 seconds of each timer. To disable either of these, click the appropriate boxes below the caption. Clicking anywhere in this square will not affect the timer.
